#### Setting:
A Polynesian themed bar located in the underground district of Neo-Tokyo, Crescent Bar is a portal to a distant cyberpunk future and venue for recorded conversations.  Bar owner hahawolf.eth explores the [cypherpunk ethos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) and growing [importance of cryptography](/an-important-truth-few-people-agree-with), but really, more than anything, Crescent Bar is a place where adults can be kids... play, laugh, and explore their curiosities.
