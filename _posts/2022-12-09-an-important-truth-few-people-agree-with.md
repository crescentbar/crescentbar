## Background

The FTX meltdown is shining light on the crypto industry, and it's not surprising that many people I talk to today are skeptical, uninterested, or outspoken critics of crypto. I don't blame them, between the superbowl ads, sports stadium naming and other gratuitous spending, press that highlights nothing but scams, environmental concerns, folks losing their life savings or getting rich overnight, and now the FTX fraud, what's left to like? A [recent CNBC poll](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/just-8percent-of-americans-have-a-positive-view-of-cryptocurrencies-now-cnbc-survey-finds.html) suggests only 8% of Americans have a positive view of cryptocurrencies.

Unfortunately, the onslaught of bad optics is masking technology that I believe will be a massive force for good in the decades to come. Let’s dig in…

## Thesis
**"What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"** My answer today:

> **The internet is one of humanity's greatest technological achievements, and I believe blockchain technology provides the rails for an internet of value revolution that will eventually disrupt and reshape the world more dramatically than the original internet itself. The fundamental value proposition of blockchains is internet native scarcity. It's difficult to fully conceptualize and articulate the scope of what this unlocks, but it often keeps me up at night, and may well eventually reorder the entire world financial and banking system, nation state governance, taxation, social services and social coordination, financial coordination (corporations), commerce, sports, and entertainment, and on and on. That reordering will be inherently more transparent and fair than the systems we live with today.**
