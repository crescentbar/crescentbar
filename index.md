Welcome to Crescent Bar, where tropical vibes of the South Pacific collide with the gritty, neon-lit streets of Cyberpunk Neo-Tokyo. My name is Peter, but most here know me as Hahawolf; and I'll be your guide as we explore this unusual establishment deep in the heart of the underground district.

You'll hear the stories, secrets, and passions of the regulars who call Crescent Bar home, as well as the passing travelers seeking refuge from the harsh reality above.

This world will unfold slowly, revealing itself bit by bit in a nonlinear fashion, exploring the [cypherpunk ethos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) and the [importance cryptography](/an-important-truth-few-people-agree-with), or lack thereof, will play in our future world.  Some episodes may go deep into this world-building, while others are lighthearted conversations with bar patrons.

No matter what, the drinks are cold and the stories are hot!  So grab a seat, the bartenders will mix you a Zombie, and let's escape the hum of the sprawling city above.
